# LunaPal Architecture Demo
### High-Level SwiftUI Client Sample (Coordinator + DI + Modular Features)

This repository provides a **public, non-production demonstration** of the high-level architectural 
patterns used in **LunaPal**, a privacy-first, SwiftUI-based life-management platform.
It includes a lightweight SwiftUI sample app that showcases:

- Coordinator-based navigation
- Dependency Injection container
- Modular feature folder structure
- Mock API + models
- Reusable SwiftUI Components
- Public system architecture diagram

> **Important:**
> This repository **does not** contain any production code, real logic, schemas, database structure, or
> internal proprietary implementation used by LunaPal.
> It is strictly for educational, portfolio, and architectural demonstration purposes.

## What This Repo Demonstrates

### SwiftUI App Structure
- Clear seperation of concerns
- Coordinator pattern for navigation
- Dependency Injection for testability & modularity
- Shared components for consistent UI

### Modular Feature Architecture
The demo includes placeholder modules resembling LunaPal's ecosystem:

- Health
- Finance
- Productivity
- Pets
- Education

These use simple SwifUI screens to demonstrate modular folder structure - with **no real LunaPal logic included**.

### Mock Networking Layer
A small, safe mock API service demonstrates:

- Protocol-driven design
- Async/await usage
- Injectable API service for previews & testing

### Public Architecture Diagram
The repo includes a **high-level visual overview** of LunaPal's real system architecture, including:

- SwiftUI client
- FastAPI backend (Azure)
- Supabase Auth + RLS-secured Postgres
- Azure Zero-Trust boundary
- On-device AI via Apple Foundation Models

(see `/Architecture` folder)

## Technology Overview

This demo represents patterns inspired by the real LunaPal tech stack:

- **SwiftUI** - iOS client app
- **Coordinator Pattern** - Declarative navigation
- **Dependency Injection** - Modular architecture
- **Mock API (Protocol-Driven)** - Demonstrates clean network abstraction

### Real LunaPal technologies (NOT included here):

- FastAPI backend on **Azure Cloud**
- **Azure Zero-Trust** network segmentation
- Supabase **Auth & Postgres (RLS)**
- On-device AI using **Apple Foundation Models**
- Encrypted cloud data flows
- Modular features across 100+ app categories

---

## Security & Privacy Notice

This repository contains **no**:

- Real LunaPal code
- Real business logic
- Real database schemas
- Supabase migrations
- API endpoints
- Encryption logic
- Internals of DI or Coordinator from production
- Proprietary algorithms

It is **100% safe**, non-sensitive, and intentionally simplified.

## Running the Sample App

Open the project in XCode:

`Build & run on iOS Simulator`

The sample home screen will display category cards lining to placeholder module screens.

## Final Note

This repository is designed to showcase **engineering maturity**, not application functionality.

It demonstrates that LunaPal:

- Is architected professionally
- Uses scalable design patterns
- Values privacy, security, and modularity
- Has a strong engineering foundation

While keeping all real IP secure.
